It has long been understood that there are biological differences between sexes, but it has only been around a decade since federally funded biomedical research has been required to include females in the U.S.

And it is more important than ever to recognize the importance of these differences and to fully fund research on women’s health, according to Arizona State University President’s Professor Heather Bimonte-Nelson, who has been studying female neurobiology and the impact of hormones during aging for decades.

For example, women are more likely to be misdiagnosed when having a heart attack than men. This discrepancy happens because women experience different symptoms from men, such as anxiety or shoulder pain — and until a few years ago, these symptoms were not widely publicized or communicated to the medical community.

Bimonte-Nelson recently authored an essay on how sex inclusivity in science benefits all of us. She explains that science has a lot left to discover about sex differences that will be impactful to human health across the lifespan.

Question: Why is it important for basic science research and clinical research to include both male and female participants?

Answer: Studies using only males make up the majority of the biomedical literature, but sex and sex hormones affect every level of our biology, from molecules to cells to entire systems, even including overall brain structure. Innumerable scientific principles and profiles of disease manifestation, symptom presentation and sequalaeThe aftereffects of a disease, condition or injury. are based on studies performed only in males, which means female data are interpreted to be a variant arising from a male-centric gold standard. This is inappropriate and insufficient at best. It should not be assumed that outcomes in one sex will apply to all individuals — because they do not.

Q: Does basic biology or cognition really differ across the sexes?

A: The short answer is yes.

Many developmental, neuropsychiatric, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders vary by sex in their prevalence, symptomology and progression. For example, premature female infants recover better from intracranial hemorrhage than do males; women are more likely to be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders and major depressive disorders; and there is a male bias in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders, with sex differences in symptom presentation including restricted, repetitive and externalizing behavior patterns. There are sex differences in long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury that have a distinct molecular-associated inflammatory signature. Women are nearly two times more likely than men to develop an adverse drug reaction. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office showed that of 10 drugs withdrawn from the U.S. market over a four-year time frame, eight of them had greater health risks in women, with the report concluding that this was driven by a lack of representation of females in the studies leading to FDA approval. Yet, the majority of drugs lack sex-specific recommendations and guidelines.

About a decade ago, the National Institutes of Health formally mandated that males and females must be considered in the design, analysis and reporting of all federally funded biomedical research. While this has been an important turning point, finding sex differences in a domain does not mean that they are well-characterized. Discovering driving mechanisms, symptomology and treatment outcomes are necessary to obtain the bigger picture and have a real impact on health and disease.

Q: What motivated you to study women’s health and cognition?

A: I am driven to discover factors that impact women’s health and sex differences relating to neurological functions because there is a marked knowledge gap in this domain. My lab focuses on neurological functions such as memory, depression and anxiety because they impact everyday quality of life in women.

Memory can decline with menopause, and depression and anxiety have been shown to increase during this time as well. How specific menopause types, prior hormone exposures and subsequent hormone therapies impact these outcomes have yet to be determined, but there is evidence that they each influence neurological function. My lab is working to decipher which variations of menopause and hormone exposures across the lifespan impact these brain functions and to identify the biological drivers of these effects. 

Q: What do you want everyone to understand about what there is to gain from studying sex differences?

A: Sex differences are one type of individual difference that are relevant to health and disease. Female biology, anatomy and function should not be dismissed and treated as irrelevant. We will not have rigor, precision and excellence in science and medicine without accuracy, and accuracy requires an accounting of the variables that impact health and disease. The studies done to date provide indisputable evidence that sex is one of these variables. Sex differences should be studied and embraced, and need not be a barrier to scientific discovery. Only when we embrace this source of individual variability will we have rigor, precision and excellence in science and medicine. ... When we have this, we impact all individuals.

As both Arizona State University and Taiwan have become major players in Arizona’s burgeoning semiconductor industry, the university has worked to nurture its ties to the island.

This fall, ASU President Michael Crow traveled to Taiwan to meet with top leaders in industry and education, as well as with ASU alumni.

“We talked about how ASU can partner and deliver workforce at scale for TSMC and other industry partners, as well as have a place for Taiwanese companies and innovations to grow in Arizona,” said Grace O’Sullivan, vice president of corporate engagement and strategic partnerships for ASU, who accompanied Crow to Taiwan.

ASU has seen an uptick of Sun Devils coming from Taiwan in recent years. Overall, 531 students from Taiwan studied at ASU in the 2024–25 academic year, an increase of more than 70% from 2021–22.

Also this fall, a delegation from Taiwan traveled to Arizona for SEMICON West, the flagship U.S. microelectronics trade show, held in Phoenix for the first time, and signed an agreement while they were here. ASU, the Arizona Commerce Authority, the city of Phoenix and Taiwan Digital Health Industry Development Association all signed a “declaration of collaboration” to promote Taiwanese companies in the U.S. and global markets with Arizona as a hub.

The signing also celebrated the opening of the Taiwan AI Smart Health Showcase Center, which features 15 innovative Taiwan-based health care companies, based in the 850 PBC building in the Phoenix Bioscience Core.

The agreement’s goals are to:

“Advancement in biomedical and medical device industries will not only drive innovation in patient care and scientific discovery, it will produce devices and therapies that will help treat chronic conditions and reduce health care costs,” Crow said at the signing.

“Arizona State University is excited to be part of this collaborative effort, working with partners in Arizona and Taiwan, to strengthen resilience in this important area of technological convergence.”

While in Taiwan, Crow met with the president and leadership team of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

O’Sullivan said that ASU is comparable to NYCU, which not only has expertise in semiconductors but also created one of the first biomedical engineering-based medical schools, similar to ASU’s new John Shufeldt School of Medicine and Medical Engineering.

“We’re working toward building a comprehensive partnership with them, including a seed research fund and curriculum exchanges,” she said.

“We also met with the Ministry of Education and talked about building English and Mandarin language training, back and forth, to further support students and exchanges.”

A key part of Crow’s visit was meeting with the leadership team at TSMC, where he thanked them for their partnership with ASU, which is the No. 1 supplier of workers to them in Arizona.

“ASU’s partnership with TSMC and Taiwan fuses leading semiconductor innovation with bold research and scalable talent pipelines, which will be the foundation for our AI and quantum future,” O’Sullivan said.

“It’s a catalyst for U.S. leadership and will create trillions in global impact.”

The trip also included meetings with leadership from the Industrial Technology Research Institute, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the latter two highlighting ASU’s Innovation Zones as a catalyst for enhancing STEM research, education and development.

While in Asia, Crow traveled to South Korea, where he met with LG Energy Solution, which has invested $5.5 billion in battery manufacturing facilities in Queen Creek, Arizona; NAVER, the dominant search engine in South Korea; KRAFTON, one of the world’s largest video gaming companies; and education leaders.

Arizona State University will pay special tribute to Vietnam veterans and their families during this year’s Salute to Service, taking place Nov. 7–16.

In addition to honoring all who have served in the military and their communities, ASU is commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War with a “welcome home” for its veterans.  

Over a dozen events are scheduled across ASU’s Phoenix metro campuses, including the Salute to Service football game against West Virginia, which will also be the Sun Devil’s Homecoming game.

“Salute to Service coinciding with Homecoming makes this year’s celebration extra special,” said Michelle Loposky, Salute to Service committee chair and strategic partnerships director with the Pat Tillman Veterans Center. “It’s truly a blend of the two, a homecoming for our Sun Devil family and for our Vietnam veterans.”

Welcoming home Vietnam veterans is a great idea and long overdue, said alum Andy Gilb, who served on active duty as an Army officer after completing ROTC at ASU and graduating in 1973.

“Although I never did a tour in Vietnam, most of the non-commissioned officers I served with had done multiple tours,” Gilb said. “I greatly respected them for their sacrifices and strong leadership.

“ASU recognizing Vietnam veterans, or any veterans, is outstanding. It’s the right thing to do. Those veterans did their job, served their time, and to have that remembrance in their honor is impressive.”

ASU is home to over 20,000 military-connected learners, including veterans, active duty members, Guard, reservists and military family members. The Pat Tillman Veterans Center helps military students transition to academic life, while offering programs and opportunities to grow and prepare for life after graduation. 

Throughout Salute to Service, ASU will host a wide range of events recognizing military service and community impact, from panel discussions, book talks and film screenings to health exhibits, concerts and family activities. Students, faculty, alumni and the public are invited to participate in experiences that highlight service and honor those who have served the nation and their communities.

Arizona is about to enter a new era when it comes to water rights and distribution.

The state’s main source of surface water — the Colorado River — has been dwindling as a result of climate change and increased water demand.

That means less water for approximately 40 million people in two countries, seven states and 30 Native American tribes. And the rules that govern how states face water cuts are set to expire on Dec. 31, 2026.

The seven states involved have struggled to reach an agreement regarding the future of these cuts. But whatever the outcome may be of negotiations or potential litigation between these seven states, experts say that Valley residents face significant water risks, including:

One Arizona State University expert says not to panic but be prepared to open your wallet.

Rhett Larson, the Richard Morrison Professor of Water Law at ASU’s Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, estimates water prices could significantly increase in some parts of the Valley if Arizona cannot come to an equitable and sustainable agreement with the other six states on how to share in decreased flows of the Colorado River.

“Arizona is not running out of water. We are running out of cheap water,” said Larson, who is also a senior research fellow with the Kyl Center for Water Policy at ASU's Morrison Institute for Public Policy. “This means not just higher water rates, but also difficult choices on economic trade-offs — for example, higher food prices due to less water for agriculture but lower housing prices with more water for residential growth.”

ASU News spoke to several water policy scholars to get a behind-the-scenes look at how the seven states are working together on the new agreement, what are some viable options in case of a shortfall, and what Arizona’s future looks like when it comes to its most precious resource.

Over the past century, the Colorado River's flow has declined by about 20%. With rising temperatures and declining Rocky Mountain snowpack, scientists have predicted flow reductions of up to 30% by mid-century.

The seven states within the Colorado River basin are under increasing pressure to develop long-term management strategies, as the existing agreements are set to expire at the end of 2026. A significant challenge lies in managing the persistent drought while balancing the requirements of stakeholders, including agricultural interests, urban water consumers, environmental needs and Indigenous rights holders.

In response to a prolonged drought, diminishing storage capacities and increasing demands for Colorado River water, the secretary of the interior issued a directive in May 2005 for reclamation to formulate enhanced strategies aimed at optimizing the coordinated management of the reservoirs within the Colorado River system.

On April 23, 2007, all seven states signed an interim agreement that memorialized the consensus recommendation to the secretary. Those rules have remained in place for the last 18 years, but the flow of recent events demand dramatic action.

“There’s no way that this ends without lower water supplies in Arizona,” Larson said. “Even the best-case scenario means that Arizona will have to make do with less water.”

However, Larson said there’s been progress as of late. He said there is a proposal on the table where the upper basin states would shift the way the water is measured to align more closely with reality.

“There have been some promising breakthroughs, but it could also collapse into litigation,” said Larson.

In addition to his roles at ASU, Larson is also an attorney for the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association, serves on Arizona’s Water Infrastructure Finance Authority Water Conservation Grant Fund Committee and sits on the board of directors of the Arizona-Mexico Commission.

“There’s a decent chance the states of the basin will sue each other in the United States Supreme Court, and who knows how that will play out?” he said.

If the seven Colorado River basin states can’t come to an agreement by the deadline, Arizona does have other water options. Some are legal, some are logistical and some are long shots. And they all come with a price tag.

“Trends are pointing to the fact that the Colorado River is becoming drier and I think it would be safe to say that the Central Arizona Project won’t be as large a provider of water as at present,” said Enrique Vivoni, ASU’s Fulton Professor of Hydrosystems Engineering in the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment and the director of the Center for Hydrologic Innovations. “So, if that’s the case, it means Arizona will have to start thinking about replacing that water supply. That would require investments.”

Vivoni, whose research focuses on hydrology and water resources, said Arizona has several water augmentation options at its disposal. They include groundwater extraction, water desalination, reservoir expansion, wastewater reclamation and interbasin transfers from other areas.

All these options require complex agreements and investments.

For example, Vivoni said groundwater extraction would require major investment in infrastructure, such as new wells and pipelines to bring water supplies to existing systems. The desalination option could involve paying to build a plant in Mexico in exchange for a portion of their Colorado River water. Expansion of Arizona’s Bartlett Reservoir capacity will require raising the dam to retain more Verde River water.

“All of these options require capital expenses and large operations and maintenance costs on an annual basis,” Vivoni said. “It’s going to require some hard choices. There will be some winners and some losers, and it’s going to require some behavioral changes by individuals, residents, communities, industry and cities.”

In addition to the costs of tapping groundwater, ASU researchers recently reported that the state’s unseen groundwater losses have been great as well.

Karem Abdelmohsen, Jay Famiglietti and colleagues used orbiting satellites to measure changes in groundwater from 2002 to 2024 in the Colorado River basin, in comparison to losses in streamflow and reservoir storage.

The satellite study found that groundwater depletion accounted for more than half of the total water storage loss in the upper Colorado River basin and more than two-thirds of losses in the lower Colorado River basin, which is greater than the losses in lakes Powell and Mead.

“The rate of depletion has actually accelerated over the last decade,” said Famiglietti, science director for ASU’s Arizona Water Innovation Initiative.

With less access to water from the Colorado River, demand for groundwater will grow. Famiglietti said that the effectiveness of groundwater management varies across the Colorado River basin states, leaving the resource open to overexploitation.

If the seven states don’t come to an agreement soon, one possible scenario is that the secretary of the interior would make unilateral decisions on cuts and deliveries. Such actions would likely lead to lawsuits challenging the secretary’s authority to do so.

“Not having a consensus agreement in place means we could go from relative certainty about the conditions of shortage to total uncertainty,” said Kathryn Sorensen, who oversees the research efforts of the Kyl Center for Water Policy, serves as a professor of practice at the Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions and contributes to the Global Futures Laboratory. “What we don’t want is someone making those decisions for us.”

That lack of certainty could lead to many drawbacks, according to Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy.

“Being in the dark about this situation could lead to higher (water) prices,” Porter said. “It could also lead to a disruption in economic development and the state’s prosperity. Not having clarity regarding how much water will be available over the long term could impact the state’s ability to attract industry. If there’s too much uncertainty about our long-term water supplies, then we’re not a good bet for investment.”

But water scarcity is not a new issue for Arizona. The state has a history of managing limited resources for collective benefit.

And that’s reason for hope as the state faces these current challenges.

“If you look at the history of water management in the Phoenix area, it’s a story of adaptation and overcoming obstacles and finding ways to be innovative,” Sorensen said. “We know how to do more with less, and we’re good at it.”

We’re also good at problem-solving and finding solutions, Porter said.

“I’m very optimistic about our water future because we’ve had over 100 years as a seven-state basin to figure out solutions,” Porter said. “I’m also optimistic because I’ve seen how creative and dedicated Arizona municipal water managers are — they’re resourceful, prepared and have their short- and long-term plans in place.

“I think there’s going to be water to help us enjoy a good quality of life and a thriving economy for central Arizona for a long time.”

“I’m very passionate about that from a personal perspective, from my own research interests and the amazing opportunities that are in front of us to unleash innovation and talent for global good,” said Panchanathan, who also is a prolific inventor with several patents and copyrights, and a writer with nearly 500 published papers in journals and conferences.

As director of the NSF, Panchanathan says his main focus was “to ensure that innovation thrives everywhere across our country, thereby leading to opportunities for everyone.”

He envisioned and launched the new Technology, Innovation and Partnerships Directorate, the first new directorate in 31 years at NSF, which leverages and energizes fundamental discoveries to supercharge in-place innovation throughout the country. He launched the GRANTED program, which ensures that all institutions are capable of translating their ideas into successful funded projects, and launched a global centers program with several projects focused on addressing shared global challenges with like-minded international partners.

Also during his tenure at NSF, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and next-gen wireless were strengthened and accelerated. For example, under his leadership, NSF launched 27 AI institutes that focused on agriculture, weather, learning, advanced materials and astronomical sciences. These institutes span the country with NSF and partnership investments exceeding half a billion dollars.

He also oversaw the development of the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot, an access point for researchers and educators to advance research ideas in AI and train the next generation of AI talent.

“Typically, frontier infrastructure is only available in industry,” Panchanathan said. “It’s pretty expensive, and in some cases it’s also complex in terms of converging all of that for research and development. We therefore wanted to democratize access by bringing in partners, co-investing and making that available for researchers and students in various universities and community colleges so they can advance their ideas in AI.”

Panchanathan said that what he did nationally while at NSF mirrors what he did at ASU, regionally and locally, with enterprises like SkySong and MacroTechnology Works, which serve as labs, fostering collaborations with industry partners and startups.

ASU President Michael Crow said the university is excited to welcome back Panchanathan as he blazes new trails in AI, quantum, semiconductors and health care.

“Panch and I have worked together for more than two decades to make ASU a pioneer in use-inspired research and to prepare our nation’s future innovation leaders,” Crow said. “Panch’s vision, energy and global engagements were integral to ASU becoming a force in science and technology.”

Panchanathan said that in the next five years, ASU can be at the forefront of setting the groundwork for a model AI university/learning enterprise.

“I don’t even want to use the word university because that gives a connotation that somehow it’s about four-year degree programs and master’s degrees and PhDs and so on,” he said. “It’s about how an AI enterprise can be built that can completely transform how people learn, live and contribute. Such an enterprise should advance AI literacy, AI competency and AI expertise.”

Another of Panchanathan’s goals for the university is continuing to strengthen the educational partnerships between ASU and India. ASU is the top university home in the U.S. for students from India, and its Indian alumni network exceeds 12,600 alumni.

“The oldest democracy and the largest democracy working together can pioneer new models of discovery and learning that ensure good quality of life and prosperity for all at speed and scale,” said Panchanathan, who in May was awarded the Padma Shri, a symbol of national gratitude in India that is awarded for excellence in the fields of art, education, industry, science, medicine, social service and public affairs.

“Our students here and our research partnerships with industry in both nations is something that can continue to enrich students and set the stage for the future.” 

Panchanathan said his immediate mission is to continue the work he did at the NSF in advocating for the importance of science and technology to American competitiveness.

“I’m a huge fan of democratization of talent, and ideas all across the country being energized, inspired, motivated, nurtured and brought to life,” he said. “This will guarantee that we, as a nation, can outcompete by out-innovating.”

Photo by Laura Fields/Arizona State University

It has long been understood that there are biological differences between sexes, but it has only been around a decade since federally funded biomedical research has been required to include females in the U.S.

And it is more important than ever to recognize the importance of these differences and to fully fund research on women’s health, according to Arizona State University President’s Professor Heather Bimonte-Nelson, who has been studying female neurobiology and the impact of hormones during aging for decades.

For example, women are more likely to be misdiagnosed when having a heart attack than men. This discrepancy happens because women experience different symptoms from men, such as anxiety or shoulder pain — and until a few years ago, these symptoms were not widely publicized or communicated to the medical community.

Bimonte-Nelson recently authored an essay on how sex inclusivity in science benefits all of us. She explains that science has a lot left to discover about sex differences that will be impactful to human health across the lifespan.

Question: Why is it important for basic science research and clinical research to include both male and female participants?

Answer: Studies using only males make up the majority of the biomedical literature, but sex and sex hormones affect every level of our biology, from molecules to cells to entire systems, even including overall brain structure. Innumerable scientific principles and profiles of disease manifestation, symptom presentation and sequalaeThe aftereffects of a disease, condition or injury. are based on studies performed only in males, which means female data are interpreted to be a variant arising from a male-centric gold standard. This is inappropriate and insufficient at best. It should not be assumed that outcomes in one sex will apply to all individuals — because they do not.

Q: Does basic biology or cognition really differ across the sexes?

A: The short answer is yes.

Many developmental, neuropsychiatric, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders vary by sex in their prevalence, symptomology and progression. For example, premature female infants recover better from intracranial hemorrhage than do males; women are more likely to be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders and major depressive disorders; and there is a male bias in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders, with sex differences in symptom presentation including restricted, repetitive and externalizing behavior patterns. There are sex differences in long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury that have a distinct molecular-associated inflammatory signature. Women are nearly two times more likely than men to develop an adverse drug reaction. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office showed that of 10 drugs withdrawn from the U.S. market over a four-year time frame, eight of them had greater health risks in women, with the report concluding that this was driven by a lack of representation of females in the studies leading to FDA approval. Yet, the majority of drugs lack sex-specific recommendations and guidelines.

About a decade ago, the National Institutes of Health formally mandated that males and females must be considered in the design, analysis and reporting of all federally funded biomedical research. While this has been an important turning point, finding sex differences in a domain does not mean that they are well-characterized. Discovering driving mechanisms, symptomology and treatment outcomes are necessary to obtain the bigger picture and have a real impact on health and disease.

Q: What motivated you to study women’s health and cognition?

A: I am driven to discover factors that impact women’s health and sex differences relating to neurological functions because there is a marked knowledge gap in this domain. My lab focuses on neurological functions such as memory, depression and anxiety because they impact everyday quality of life in women.

Memory can decline with menopause, and depression and anxiety have been shown to increase during this time as well. How specific menopause types, prior hormone exposures and subsequent hormone therapies impact these outcomes have yet to be determined, but there is evidence that they each influence neurological function. My lab is working to decipher which variations of menopause and hormone exposures across the lifespan impact these brain functions and to identify the biological drivers of these effects. 

Q: What do you want everyone to understand about what there is to gain from studying sex differences?

A: Sex differences are one type of individual difference that are relevant to health and disease. Female biology, anatomy and function should not be dismissed and treated as irrelevant. We will not have rigor, precision and excellence in science and medicine without accuracy, and accuracy requires an accounting of the variables that impact health and disease. The studies done to date provide indisputable evidence that sex is one of these variables. Sex differences should be studied and embraced, and need not be a barrier to scientific discovery. Only when we embrace this source of individual variability will we have rigor, precision and excellence in science and medicine. ... When we have this, we impact all individuals.

As both Arizona State University and Taiwan have become major players in Arizona’s burgeoning semiconductor industry, the university has worked to nurture its ties to the island.

This fall, ASU President Michael Crow traveled to Taiwan to meet with top leaders in industry and education, as well as with ASU alumni.

“We talked about how ASU can partner and deliver workforce at scale for TSMC and other industry partners, as well as have a place for Taiwanese companies and innovations to grow in Arizona,” said Grace O’Sullivan, vice president of corporate engagement and strategic partnerships for ASU, who accompanied Crow to Taiwan.

ASU has seen an uptick of Sun Devils coming from Taiwan in recent years. Overall, 531 students from Taiwan studied at ASU in the 2024–25 academic year, an increase of more than 70% from 2021–22.

Also this fall, a delegation from Taiwan traveled to Arizona for SEMICON West, the flagship U.S. microelectronics trade show, held in Phoenix for the first time, and signed an agreement while they were here. ASU, the Arizona Commerce Authority, the city of Phoenix and Taiwan Digital Health Industry Development Association all signed a “declaration of collaboration” to promote Taiwanese companies in the U.S. and global markets with Arizona as a hub.

The signing also celebrated the opening of the Taiwan AI Smart Health Showcase Center, which features 15 innovative Taiwan-based health care companies, based in the 850 PBC building in the Phoenix Bioscience Core.

The agreement’s goals are to:

“Advancement in biomedical and medical device industries will not only drive innovation in patient care and scientific discovery, it will produce devices and therapies that will help treat chronic conditions and reduce health care costs,” Crow said at the signing.

“Arizona State University is excited to be part of this collaborative effort, working with partners in Arizona and Taiwan, to strengthen resilience in this important area of technological convergence.”

While in Taiwan, Crow met with the president and leadership team of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

O’Sullivan said that ASU is comparable to NYCU, which not only has expertise in semiconductors but also created one of the first biomedical engineering-based medical schools, similar to ASU’s new John Shufeldt School of Medicine and Medical Engineering.

“We’re working toward building a comprehensive partnership with them, including a seed research fund and curriculum exchanges,” she said.

“We also met with the Ministry of Education and talked about building English and Mandarin language training, back and forth, to further support students and exchanges.”

A key part of Crow’s visit was meeting with the leadership team at TSMC, where he thanked them for their partnership with ASU, which is the No. 1 supplier of workers to them in Arizona.

“ASU’s partnership with TSMC and Taiwan fuses leading semiconductor innovation with bold research and scalable talent pipelines, which will be the foundation for our AI and quantum future,” O’Sullivan said.

“It’s a catalyst for U.S. leadership and will create trillions in global impact.”

The trip also included meetings with leadership from the Industrial Technology Research Institute, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the latter two highlighting ASU’s Innovation Zones as a catalyst for enhancing STEM research, education and development.

While in Asia, Crow traveled to South Korea, where he met with LG Energy Solution, which has invested $5.5 billion in battery manufacturing facilities in Queen Creek, Arizona; NAVER, the dominant search engine in South Korea; KRAFTON, one of the world’s largest video gaming companies; and education leaders.

Arizona State University will pay special tribute to Vietnam veterans and their families during this year’s Salute to Service, taking place Nov. 7–16.

In addition to honoring all who have served in the military and their communities, ASU is commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War with a “welcome home” for its veterans.  

Over a dozen events are scheduled across ASU’s Phoenix metro campuses, including the Salute to Service football game against West Virginia, which will also be the Sun Devil’s Homecoming game.

“Salute to Service coinciding with Homecoming makes this year’s celebration extra special,” said Michelle Loposky, Salute to Service committee chair and strategic partnerships director with the Pat Tillman Veterans Center. “It’s truly a blend of the two, a homecoming for our Sun Devil family and for our Vietnam veterans.”

Welcoming home Vietnam veterans is a great idea and long overdue, said alum Andy Gilb, who served on active duty as an Army officer after completing ROTC at ASU and graduating in 1973.

“Although I never did a tour in Vietnam, most of the non-commissioned officers I served with had done multiple tours,” Gilb said. “I greatly respected them for their sacrifices and strong leadership.

“ASU recognizing Vietnam veterans, or any veterans, is outstanding. It’s the right thing to do. Those veterans did their job, served their time, and to have that remembrance in their honor is impressive.”

ASU is home to over 20,000 military-connected learners, including veterans, active duty members, Guard, reservists and military family members. The Pat Tillman Veterans Center helps military students transition to academic life, while offering programs and opportunities to grow and prepare for life after graduation. 

Throughout Salute to Service, ASU will host a wide range of events recognizing military service and community impact, from panel discussions, book talks and film screenings to health exhibits, concerts and family activities. Students, faculty, alumni and the public are invited to participate in experiences that highlight service and honor those who have served the nation and their communities.

This fall, four Arizona State University faculty members have added a new title to their list of merits: President’s Professor.

The designation, one of the most prestigious faculty honors, is given to honor and reward inspiration and innovation in the classroom, as well as research and scholarly contributions.

The 2025 awardees are: K. Selçuk Candan and Sarah Stabenfeldt in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, and Steve Semken and Cindi SturtzSreetharan in The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Learn more about these professors and their accomplishments:

Canden, a professor of computer science and engineering in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, is internationally recognized for his pioneering work in managing and analyzing large, complex and often imprecise datasets — ranging from multimedia and web content to scientific research data and medical records.

Over his nearly three decades at ASU, he has authored more than 250 peer-reviewed articles, holds 10 patents and has secured more than $34 million in research funding to advance data-driven decision-making.

Candan has mentored dozens of doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, often extending his support to high school researchers. His teaching is celebrated for blending technical depth with real-world relevance, sparking curiosity and creativity in students who go on to become leaders in academia, industry and public service.

“Being a teacher and mentor is the most rewarding part of my career,” Candan says. “I want my students to see that the concepts we study are not just abstract theories but tools that can be used to solve real problems and make a difference in people’s lives. This recognition is truly an honor because it reflects the success and growth of the students I’ve had the privilege to work with.”

Ross Maciejewski, director of the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, says the recognition is well deserved.

“Selçuk’s career is a masterclass in how to integrate scholarly excellence with a deep commitment to student success,” Maciejewski says. “He’s not only advanced the field of data science in areas like public health, sustainability and artificial intelligence, but he’s also inspired generations of students through his enthusiasm, mentorship and innovation in teaching. His impact on ASU and beyond will be felt for decades.”

Stabenfeldt is a distinguished professor at the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering and serves on numerous scientific journal editorial boards and review panels.

Since joining the ASU community in 2011, Stabenfeldt has dedicated her career to researching regenerative medicine strategies for acute neural injury. Her efforts have been honored with an array of accolades, including the 2015 Arizona Biomedical Research Consortium Early-Stage Investigator Award, the National Institutes of Health Director’s New Innovator Award and the 2015 National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Award. She recently received the Mosaic Award for her dedication to the biomedical engineering community.

“From day one, it was clear to me that ASU provides opportunities to innovate in all aspects of a faculty’s role,” Stabenfeldt says. “This mindset, along with commitment to advancing education for all to succeed, keeps me motivated to contribute to ASU’s vision/mission for years to come.”

Stabenfeldt is co-leading a regenerative medicine graduate training program that fosters transdisciplinary skills and connects students with the booming local biotech industry.

“Sarah is an amazing asset to ASU, and our students benefit every day from her time here,” says Heather Clark, director of the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering. “Whether it’s in the classroom or lab, she touches a lot of lives.”

Semken is a professor of geology and education in the School of Earth and Space Exploration. His work spans geological heritage, virtual field education and the geological evolution of southwestern North America.

He is a Geological Society of America Fellow and has served as past-president and a distinguished speaker of the National Association of Geoscience Teachers. His scholarship actively informs his teaching, where he engages students through culturally responsive, place-based methods that spark curiosity and encourage active learning.

Semken is also a co-creator of the award-winning Trail of Time interpretive trail at Grand Canyon National Park. Beyond the university, he shares his passion for geology with the public through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at ASU and at Yavapai College in Arizona’s Verde Valley, and by leading geologic hikes at many state and national parks.

""I am humbled by and truly grateful for this recognition, as the scholarship and effective practice of geoscience teaching have always been of greatest professional importance to me,” Semken said. “I deeply appreciate the enthusiasm of my students and the support of my colleagues at ASU and count myself very fortunate to be able to live, work and teach in beautiful Arizona.""

“This is a very well-deserved honor for Professor Semken. He is a serious and dedicated teacher focused on Earth science literacy,” said Ramon Arrowsmith, interim director for the School of Earth and Space Exploration. “He is deeply committed to his students and colleagues and to understanding Earth science and how it is learned and relevant locally. The School of Earth and Space Exploration is very proud and honored to have him as our colleague.”

SturtzSreetharan is a highly regarded linguistic anthropologist and professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change.

She has been at the forefront of linguistic anthropology, studying how language reflects and influences society. She emphasizes language, not only as communication, but as a form of social action capable of fostering empathy, inclusion and meaningful change.

Her commitment to teaching extends beyond her classroom. She is the lead author of “Fat in Four Cultures: A Global Ethnography of Weight,” a textbook specifically written to engage undergraduates and to teach empathy around weight. She also co-authored the textbook “The Human Story: An Introduction to Anthropology,” integrating linguistic anthropology across all chapters of the introductory textbook. The four-field perspective text highlights the intersection of biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology and archaeology.

In 2024, SturtzSreetharan was recognized with both the Faculty Mentor Award by ASU’s Faculty Women’s Association and the Outstanding Doctoral Mentor Award from the ASU Graduate College, reflecting her extraordinary dedication to mentoring faculty and students.

“I am deeply honored to be awarded the title of ASU President's Professor,” SturtzSreetharan said. “I am very grateful to students, staff and faculty across ASU who provide the space and resources to constantly refine and hone my teaching and mentoring skills. I love teaching because, to my mind, it is the ultimate collaborative learning. Without students, I would never grow my teaching and mentoring.”

“She is an innovator in curriculum, a creator of opportunities for her students and a dedicated scholar committed to ASU’s charter at the highest levels,” said Ryan William, director of the School of Human Evolution and Social Change. “Her work and values as a teacher have been built on collaborative research experiences, scaling online research, innovating new fields of instruction and publishing on pedagogical innovations to share them with other scholars and the broader public.”

From his third-floor office at Arizona State University, floor-length windows give Sethuraman Panchanathan a stunning panorama of the sprawling Tempe campus.

But the view is not new to Panchanathan, Professor of Technology and Innovation and former director of the National Science Foundation.

Before becoming director of the National Science Foundation in 2020, he worked at ASU for 22 years, where he created the Center for Cognitive Ubiquitous Computing, founded the School of Computing and Informatics and the Department of Biomedical Informatics, and served as the executive vice president of ASU’s Knowledge Enterprise and the chief research and innovation officer. 

But it’s not the past that has brought Panchanathan back. It’s the future, and the trajectory that he and ASU share: the absolute belief and unwavering certainty that research matters.

“I’m very passionate about that from a personal perspective, from my own research interests and the amazing opportunities that are in front of us to unleash innovation and talent for global good,” said Panchanathan, who also is a prolific inventor with several patents and copyrights, and a writer with nearly 500 published papers in journals and conferences.

As director of the NSF, Panchanathan says his main focus was “to ensure that innovation thrives everywhere across our country, thereby leading to opportunities for everyone.”

He envisioned and launched the new Technology, Innovation and Partnerships Directorate, the first new directorate in 31 years at NSF, which leverages and energizes fundamental discoveries to supercharge in-place innovation throughout the country. He launched the GRANTED program, which ensures that all institutions are capable of translating their ideas into successful funded projects, and launched a global centers program with several projects focused on addressing shared global challenges with like-minded international partners.

Also during his tenure at NSF, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and next-gen wireless were strengthened and accelerated. For example, under his leadership, NSF launched 27 AI institutes that focused on agriculture, weather, learning, advanced materials and astronomical sciences. These institutes span the country with NSF and partnership investments exceeding half a billion dollars.

He also oversaw the development of the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot, an access point for researchers and educators to advance research ideas in AI and train the next generation of AI talent.

“Typically, frontier infrastructure is only available in industry,” Panchanathan said. “It’s pretty expensive, and in some cases it’s also complex in terms of converging all of that for research and development. We therefore wanted to democratize access by bringing in partners, co-investing and making that available for researchers and students in various universities and community colleges so they can advance their ideas in AI.”

Panchanathan said that what he did nationally while at NSF mirrors what he did at ASU, regionally and locally, with enterprises like SkySong and MacroTechnology Works, which serve as labs, fostering collaborations with industry partners and startups.

ASU President Michael Crow said the university is excited to welcome back Panchanathan as he blazes new trails in AI, quantum, semiconductors and health care.

“Panch and I have worked together for more than two decades to make ASU a pioneer in use-inspired research and to prepare our nation’s future innovation leaders,” Crow said. “Panch’s vision, energy and global engagements were integral to ASU becoming a force in science and technology.”

Panchanathan said that in the next five years, ASU can be at the forefront of setting the groundwork for a model AI university/learning enterprise.

“I don’t even want to use the word university because that gives a connotation that somehow it’s about four-year degree programs and master’s degrees and PhDs and so on,” he said. “It’s about how an AI enterprise can be built that can completely transform how people learn, live and contribute. Such an enterprise should advance AI literacy, AI competency and AI expertise.”

Another of Panchanathan’s goals for the university is continuing to strengthen the educational partnerships between ASU and India. ASU is the top university home in the U.S. for students from India, and its Indian alumni network exceeds 12,600 alumni.

“The oldest democracy and the largest democracy working together can pioneer new models of discovery and learning that ensure good quality of life and prosperity for all at speed and scale,” said Panchanathan, who in May was awarded the Padma Shri, a symbol of national gratitude in India that is awarded for excellence in the fields of art, education, industry, science, medicine, social service and public affairs.

“Our students here and our research partnerships with industry in both nations is something that can continue to enrich students and set the stage for the future.” 

Panchanathan said his immediate mission is to continue the work he did at the NSF in advocating for the importance of science and technology to American competitiveness.

“I’m a huge fan of democratization of talent, and ideas all across the country being energized, inspired, motivated, nurtured and brought to life,” he said. “This will guarantee that we, as a nation, can outcompete by out-innovating.”
